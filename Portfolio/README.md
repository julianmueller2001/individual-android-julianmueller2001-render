# - Portfolio folder

For every learning outcomes, students must document the following three sections in their **Weekly Plan & Evidence & Reflection** section in the Portfolio:

- **What did you plan to do? (Goal / Intention).**
- **What did you do? (Evidence / Action).**
- **What did you learn? and what would you do different (Reflection).**

In the **Learning outcomes and entry level** section, students indicate their entry level (see below ** ) and explain it, in their **learning outcomes reflection** section, students indicate their current level and justify it with evidence.
As coaches, we review the indicated level and provide feedback—either agreeing or explaining why not.

**

1.	Exploring: The student is becoming aware of the topic or skill but has limited experience or understanding.
2.	Beginner: The student has some basic knowledge or experience and can perform simple tasks with guidance.
3.	Developing: The student is building confidence and can apply the skill in familiar contexts with some independence.
4.	Proficient: The student demonstrates consistent and effective use of the skill in a variety of contexts.
5.	Advanced: The student shows deep understanding, can apply the skill creatively, and may support others in learning it.
6.	Mastery (optional): The student demonstrates expert-level performance and can innovate or lead in this area. 

All entries—goals, actions, and reflections—must be clearly documented in the student’s PDP within their private GitHub repository.
