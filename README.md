## - Portfolio folder

We expect each student to create a Portfolio in their individual (private) repository. This document serves as a structured record of the studentâ€™s goals, evidence of progress, and reflections on the learning outcomes throughout the semester.

The Portfolio is a living document that should be updated at least at the end of each sprint but preferably more frequently. Coaches will provide feedback during sprint reviews, and this feedback should be documented in Feedpulse.
